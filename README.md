- 👋 Hi, I’m @KarlosIII
- 👀 I’m interested in learning everything about coding, having a natural interest in back-end stuff but still interested in front-end stuff too.
- 🌱 I’m currently going trough a Full Stack "career path" on Codecademy. Right now I'm on React.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate with anyone on any projects. I'm looking to grow my coding network, as a mentor (if I can), from a mentor and through all others 
programmers experiences.
- 📫 Hook me up on Twitter @ Carl TheFrench :)
